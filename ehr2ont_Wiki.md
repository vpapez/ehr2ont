## Overview ##

The Archetype Ontologizer is an application that uses the ehr2ont framework to translate _OpenEHR_ archetypes into ontologies. Thus, it generates one _OWL_ file per each _ADL_ passed to the libraries. Resulting ontologies contain classes that not only represent their OpenEHR Reference Model counterparts but they are also constrained by the provided archetype definition. Therefore, generated _OWL_ files are semantic translation of _ADLs_ in a way that allows us to instantiate classes and properties and ventually perform inference tasks on real data.
