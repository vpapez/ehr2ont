ehr2ont is a generic Java library aimed at the translation of OpenEHR (http://www.openehr.org/) archetypes to ontology languages.

OpenEHR archetypes are reusable definitions for fragments of clinical information. Translating them to ontology languages enables the use of inference and the mapping to existing formal ontologies in the biomedical and clinical domains.

ehr2ont currently supports (a part of) OpenEHR ADL version 1.2. and generates and uses OWL.
